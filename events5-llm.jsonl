Known for his use of modest, everyday materials, de Nieves explores aesthetic beauty while challenging its historical and religious underpinnings. His practice references Western religious traditions‚Äîparticularly, those of Catholicism‚Äîand ultimately reimagine places of worship as sites of transformation, despite their legacies of violence and exclusion. The exhibition presents the site-specific installation of 50 faux stained glass panels, all further inspired by the visual language of tarot.\n_How To Get To Zero_ marks the first-ever survey of work by residency alumni Tega Brain and Sam Lavigne. The exhibition presents a comprehensive look at the artists‚Äô solo and collaborative practices, which examine the present limits and future possibilities of political agency during our time of climate crisis. Over the past ten years, Brain and Lavigne have worked at the forefront of social critique and participatory art, examining subjects ranging from economic corruption to police surveillance, and from data manipulation to the commodification of everyday life. By repurposing the technologies used to perpetuate these conditions, the artists highlight the underlying conceptual and political frameworks that so often reinforce an unjust and repressive status quo.\n####  _Ra√∫l de Nieves:_ In Light of Innocence _is made possible with generous support by Bruce M. Halpryn and Chas Riebe with additional support provided by 1800 Tequila, public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, as well as the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature._\n####  _Tega Brain & Sam Lavigne: _How To Get To Zero _is made possible with support from Creative Capital. Exhibitions at Pioneer Works are supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature._\nBe the first to hear about new programs, exhibitions, and updates from Pioneer Works.\nSIGN UP\nOr consider helping us build community through the arts and sciences by [making a tax-deductible donation here](https://pioneerworks.org/support).\n**Visit** Wednesday-Sunday\n12-6 pm \n**Get Involved**[Support](https://pioneerworks.org/support)[Membership](https://pioneerworks.org/membership)[Rentals](https://pioneerworks.org/rentals)\n**About**[About Us](https://pioneerworks.org/about)[Visit](https://pioneerworks.org/visit)[Calendar](https://pioneerworks.org/calendar)[Contact Us](https://pioneerworks.org/visit)\n**Pioneer Works**\n159 Pioneer Street\nBrooklyn, NY 11231\n(718) 596-3001\n[Map](https://maps.google.com/?cid=14161060920714480924)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pioneerworks/)[](https://www.facebook.com/PioneerWorksFoundation/)[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvz10aafWdDEvO_4ehcr0jQ)[](https://twitter.com/pioneerworks_)\n¬©2025 Pioneer Works","extraction":{"title":"Opening Reception for Ra√∫l de Nieves, Tega Brain, and Sam Lavigne","start_date":"2025-09-12","end_date":"2025-09-13","start_time":"19:00","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"159 Pioneer Street, Brooklyn, NY 11231","image_url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/vgvol637/production/27c97dc5e87a50539dec381a43d6a347c96bb9d0-2000x1125.png?w=2000","description":"Join Pioneer Works in a public opening celebration of Ra√∫l de Nieves:In Light of Innocence and Tega Brain & Sam Lavigne: How To Get To Zero.","event_type":"Show","topics":["Visual Arts"],"source_url":"https://pioneerworks.org/programs","detail_url":"https://pioneerworks.org/programs/fall-exhibition-opening"}}

Born and raised in Los Angeles as a first-generation Mexican-American, Yara launched her culinary journey at just 20 years old, honing her skills at esteemed establishments such as Wolfgang Puck‚Äôs Spago and Providence, a celebrated two-Michelin-starred sustainable seafood restaurant. In 2018, an invitation from David Chang to join the highly acclaimed Momofuku Ko brought her to New York City, where she would go on to join the team at Xilonen (the former sister restaurant from the Oxomoco team). At Hellbender, Yara is embarking on her first chef and owner venture, showcasing her distinctive approach to Mexican-American cuisine. Quickly established as a standout dining destination in the neighborhood, Hellbender was awarded one of  _Esquire_ ‚Äôs Best New Restaurants for 2024, and granted a two star review in  _The New York Times_. Yara's culinary journey is deeply rooted in the evolution of Mexican-American flavors, where she seamlessly blends tradition with innovation. Her efforts recently attracted attention from Star Chefs, where Yara was named one of their 2025 Rising Stars.  \n\n****[Membership](https://pioneerworks.org/membership)**** helps sustain Pioneer Works' free admission model and keep our programming affordable and accessible to everybody.

Over the years, m√∫m has collaborated with diverse artists, including Kylie Minogue and the Kronos Quartet, and has been celebrated for albums like _Yesterday Was Dramatic ‚Äì Today Is OK_ (1999) and _Smilewound_ (2013).  \n\n**About the artists**\n**m√∫m** (pronunciation: [muÀêm] - moom) is an exploratory Icelandic musical group whose music is characterized by experiments in electronic music, soft vocals, glitchy beats, innovative sampling, and eerie effects with a variety of traditional and unconventional instruments. The band was formed in 1997 by founding members Gunnar √ñrn Tynes, √ñrvar Sm√°rason, and twin sisters Gyda and Krist√≠n Anna Valtysd√≥tti. Since then, the collective has released six full-length albums, as well as a mountain of other music, singles, EP‚Äôs, collaborations, theatre, and film music. The band's lineup is in a state of constant change. So is their music.  \n\n**Mr. Silla** , aka Sigurlaug G√≠slad√≥ttir, has been a fixture in the Icelandic music and art scene for decades. A member of m√∫m since 2007, their many collaborations include a host of domestic and international acts such as Mike Lindsay (Tunng), Snorri Helgason, Mice Parade, Low Roar and Sam Potter (Late of the Pier) to name a few. Multi-instrumentalist, writer, and producer, Sigurlaug has been active since 2005, recording two solo albums (Mr. Silla, Hands On Hands) to critical acclaim, captivating audiences with their evocative stage presence and arresting vocal stylings. Make sure to be blissfully aware of the upcoming album entitled _SANDS_ , the latest collaborative project of Mr. Silla & Sam Potter, set for release next year.\n#### _Presented in collaboration with[Wordless Music](https://www.wordlessmusic.org/)._\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

As fossil fuels burn and ecosystems are destroyed, heat is driving increasingly extreme weather‚Äîturbo-charging hurricanes, floods, fires, and droughts. By 2070, one-fifth of the planet could be as scorchingly hot as the (rapidly expanding) Sahara Desert, and up to 3.5 billion people may have to move as their homes become inhospitable.\nExtreme heat is a public health threat that leads to school closures, workplace injuries, droughts, famine, mental health crises, and increased domestic violence. In the United States, heat stress is [the leading cause](https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/#&_intcmp=fxw_extreme-weather_article_main-content_article-body_2_3) of weather-related deaths‚Äîkilling more people than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined. Those among us with the fewest resources are disproportionally affected‚Äîspecifically, people of color, low-income people, children, and the elderly.\nPut simply, we now live in an entirely new climate era‚Äîone that is hotter and more unpredictable‚Äîand we are inadequately prepared for the unavoidable consequences. Heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable with proper planning, education, and action. So, how do we make our homes, neighborhoods, and cities cooler? How do we design and build for the future, with heat adaptation and risk prevention in mind? How do we care for our vulnerable populations? How do we craft policies to advance climate solutions and human well-being?\nFor a conversation grappling with how we might adapt to and live in a warming world, **Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson** will host journalist and writer**Jeff Goodell** and climate resilience expert **Jainey Bavishi** for _Science & Society: Heat Advisory_. **Brad Einstein** will offer a comedic introduction (with puppets).\nCome early and stick around to explore further into the thoughts and questions surrounding heat and health with our guest specialists who will be roving, available to engage and offer insight: renowned climate modeler and Goddard Institute of Space Studies Director **Dr. Gavin Schmidt** , historian of urban and environmental history **Dr. Kara Schlichting** , and others to be included.\nBefore and after the conversation, **DJ Mamoudou** will bring the heat to the dancefloor. On the first floor, visuals will be on view by**[OceanX](https://oceanx.org/)**, a global nonprofit working to unlock the ocean's sustainable potential‚Äîto benefit both people and the planet. On the second floor, **The Climate Story Project** ‚Äîan initiative of [The New York Climate Exchange](https://nyclimateexchange.org)‚Äîinvites you to listen to personal, pre-recorded stories about climate change and to record your own. 10-minute time slots will be available throughout the evening. In the garden, stargazing with the **Amateur Astronomers‚Äô Association** will open and conclude the night, weather-permitting. All evening, **[For All Things Good](https://www.forallthingsgoodbk.com/) **will be serving up fresh Mexican food.\nOur signature series [_Science & Society_](https://pioneerworks.org/series/science-and-society) grapples with our relationships with nature and each other. Each leads us deep into humanity‚Äôs timely and intersectional challenges, from biodiversity to plastics, public knowledge, the high seas, farming, climate, and love.\n**About the Speakers**\n**Jainey Bavishi** is a nationally recognized expert in climate resilience.

He conquered Detroit's early techno scene as The Wizard in the 1980s, as part of the collective Underground Resistance. Afterwards, in the 2000s, he became inspired by space and science fiction, and started merging his interests with other art forms. He decided to create a new soundtrack for Fritz Lang's _Metropolis_ , which brought him to many other cine-mix performances and movie soundtracks. As a fine artist, Mills has shown numerous performances and exhibitions in galleries and museums such as the CCCB of Barcelona; the Southbanke Center and the Barbican in London; the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise and Pompidou Center in Paris; and the Art Fair Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n**Jean Philippe Dary** is a keyboard player, singer, producer, arranger, and songwriter. Born in France with Guyanese roots, he‚Äôs worked with African singers like Papa Wemba, Tourƒó Kunda, Omar Pene, and Alpha Blondy. He also worked on other projects and musical styles such as jazz (Paco Sery, Greg Osby, Brice Wassy, Hopen Collective, Pino Daniele), reggae (Sly And Robbie), pop and electronic music (Phoenix, Troublemakers). During these last 20 years, he has spent most of his time working with friend Tony Allen. They have recorded eight albums with artists like Jeff Mills, Damon Albarn, TY and Ernest Ranglin. He is the third member of Tomorrow Comes the Harvest.\n**Prabhu Edouard** is an Indo-French percussionist and composer. Regarded as one of the most versatile tabla players of his generation, Edouard is a worthy disciple of renowned tabla maestro Pandit Shankar Ghosh. His album _K√îLAM_ highlights his compositionally innovative and contemporary vision of Indian music. Not only a sought after performer, Edouard is also an experienced pedagogue sharing his talents during various percussion masterclasses and international music seminars.\n**Tomorrow Comes The Harvest** is the cumulative effort of talented musicians and their shared visions of what makes the art form of music so special. The concept was initiated and brought to life by the late Afrobeats creator and Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and Detroit techno pioneer Jeff Mills. Each artist belongs to a long tradition of using music to reach higher levels of consciousness. Joined by veteran keyboardist Jean-Phi Dary, the trio toured internationally until the untimely passing of Tony Allen in 2020. By then, however, the foundation of the project had been firmly established and was ready to evolve. Mills has reconfigured the concept once more as a trio, inviting tabla virtuoso Prabhu Edouard to join the ensemble.\nTomorrow Comes The Harvest is about exploring the unknown‚Äîtranscending boundaries through the intersection of sound and rhythm, guided by an array of improvisational movements.\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

With bassist Aaron Rieseberg and drummer Dave French, YOB crafts massive, meditative compositions that explore the edges of human experience, blending pulverizing sludge with moments of luminous clarity.\nFormed in the late ‚Äô90s, YOB emerged from the stoner doom lineage of Sleep and Black Sabbath, but quickly developed a signature style‚Äîpendulous riffs, skyward vocals, and deeply introspective lyrics influenced by Scheidt‚Äôs Buddhist and Advaita Vedanta spiritual practices. Their albums, from _Elaborations of Carbon_ (2002) to _Our Raw Heart_ (2018), reflect a steady deepening in both sound and self-inquiry.\nAfter a hiatus in the mid-2000s, YOB returned with renewed intensity, building a devoted following through relentless touring and acclaimed records like _Atma_ and _Clearing the Path to Ascend_ (Rolling Stone‚Äôs 2014 Metal Album of the Year). Their live shows are legendary for their emotional weight and sonic gravity‚Äîspaces of collective release where, as Scheidt puts it, ‚Äúthe crowd and the band are not two things.‚Äù\nYOB continues to evolve, with compositions that stretch across time and feeling, forged by a trio of musicians attuned to each other‚Äôs deepest intuitions. Their music doesn‚Äôt offer easy answers‚Äîbut in its searching, it opens a space for presence, healing, and transformation. As Scheidt says, ‚ÄúOur music is medicine for us. If it‚Äôs that for anyone else, it‚Äôs an immense honor.‚Äù\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

The entire program will be broadcast live on video at [Pioneer Works' YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBLMJJp360) & [WKCR 89.9 FM in NYC](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/wkcr/) (audio only).\nFor the 2025 festival, legendary maestros of the South Asian classical tradition will perform alongside groundbreaking contemporary artists in a musical journey through day and night. The artist lineup, which includes ecstatic Qawwali musicians, Grammy-winning classical maestros, and ambient projects, will be announced on September 3rd.\n**About Ragas Live Festival**\nRagas Live Festival was born as an in-studio radio broadcast at Columbia University's radio station, WKCR, in 2012 and immediately gained a global listening audience. The annual presentation of 50-70 musicians, and its expansive presentation of music inspired by the Indian classical tradition, became central to a musical movement that The New York Times, The New Yorker, NPR, and others have called ‚ÄúThe Raga Renaissance.‚Äù The event first left the studio and became a live, in-person broadcast in 2016 at Pioneer Works, where it has since grown a passionate following.\nThe event is inspired by raga, the classical music tradition from South Asia, where specific modes harmonize with the moods and energy of particular times of day, such as sunrise, sunset, or the darkest hours of the night. Master musicians from the raga tradition are presented alongside legends in ambient music, minimalism, jazz, and global traditions.\n#### _Ragas Live Festival is produced by Pioneer Works in collaboration with the Society for Arts and Culture of South Asia (Palo Alto), NYC Radio Live, People of Rhythm Productions, and Brooklyn Raga Massive. Ragas Live Festival is sponsored, in part, by the Greater New York Arts Development Fund of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, administered by Brooklyn Arts Council. Beverage sponsorship provided by Yerba Madre, as well as the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature._\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

Pioneer Works joins 2025‚Äôs festival, presenting two leaders in the experimental world: **Andy Stott** and **Carrier**(live).\n**Andy Stott‚Äôs** works, from the haunted ‚ÄúLuxury Problems‚Äù to 2021‚Äôs bruised, yet beautiful ‚ÄúNever the Right Time\", fuse eerie textures, brutal rhythms, and ghostly vocals. Opening, **Carrier** is a boundary-pushing artist known for his evolution across drum & bass, techno, and experimental music.\nTickets on sale now. For more information and festival passes visit [durations.world](https://pioneerworks.org/programs/durations.world).\n**About the artists**  \n**Andy Stott** is a Manchester producer who‚Äôs carved out a dark, raw lane between techno, post-punk, and dream pop. Early dub techno gave way to 2011‚Äôs Passed Me By and We Stay Together‚Äîgrinding, broken-down epics dubbed \"knackered house.\" His albums, from the haunted Luxury Problems to 2021‚Äôs bruised yet beautiful Never the Right Time, fuse eerie textures, brutal rhythms, and Alison Skidmore‚Äôs ghostly vocals. A key figure on Modern Love, Stott also works under aliases like Andrea and in brutalist projects like Millie & Andrea. His sound is murky, visceral, and completely his own.\n**Carrier** is the latest project from Guy Brewer, a boundary-pushing artist known for his evolution across drum & bass, techno, and experimental music. Rising to fame in the '90s, he later launched the influential Shifted project and Avian label. With Carrier, Brewer departs from genre constraints, blending decades of sonic exploration into a unified, eclectic sound that reflects his journey and artistic reinvention.\n**About the festival**\n**Durations** is a weekend-long, multi-instrumental exploration of sound, asking how music connects body, mind, memory, and imagination across time. Presented by Public Records in collaboration with Pioneer Works, the festival brings together a diasporic lineup of electronic and experimental artists and guest speakers for a series of live and club performances and presentations that push boundaries in music, philosophy, and design theory. The 2025 lineup includes a performance from **Andy Stott** onsite in PW's Main Hall, and features artists **Actress** , **Call Super** , **Lyra Pramuk,** **MARR√òN** , **Suso S√°iz** , **Tornado Wallace** , and **Vlada**. \nBe the first to hear about new programs, exhibitions, and updates from Pioneer Works.\nSIGN UP\nOr consider helping us build community through the arts and sciences by [making a tax-deductible donation here](https://pioneerworks.org/support).\n**Visit** Wednesday-Sunday\n12-6 pm \n**Get Involved**[Support](https://pioneerworks.org/support)[Membership](https://pioneerworks.org/membership)[Rentals](https://pioneerworks.org/rentals)\n**About**[About Us](https://pioneerworks.org/about)[Visit](https://pioneerworks.org/visit)[Calendar](https://pioneerworks.org/calendar)[Contact Us](https://pioneerworks.org/visit)\n**Pioneer Works**\n159 Pioneer Street\nBrooklyn, NY 11231\n(718) 596-3001\n[Map](https://maps.google.com/?cid=14161060920714480924)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pioneerworks/)[](https://www.facebook.com/PioneerWorksFoundation/)[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvz10aafWdDEvO_4ehcr0jQ)[](https://twitter.com/pioneerworks_)\n¬©2025 Pioneer Works","extraction":{"title":null,"start_date":null,"end_date":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":null,"image_url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/vgvol637/production/0ae17b06db6572be2b653be6b31f5c5b0f35ef31-5976x3984.jpg?w=800","description":null,"event_type":null,"topics":[],"source_url":"https://pioneerworks.org/programs","detail_url":"https://pioneerworks.org/programs/andy-stott-carrier"}}

A hilarious take on current events, the performance features Chokehole‚Äôs divas taking center stage‚Äîto throw, flip, and fling each other across the ring and into your hardened hearts. With acrobatics and custom backstage videos,_ARMAGEDDON_ features Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs band **Hairbone** performing a live, halftime show within the artist‚Äôs Main Hall exhibition, _In Light of Innocence_. This smackdown is not to be missed!\n**About the Artists**\n**Chokehole** is a drag wrestling event born out of New Orleans‚Äôs underground queer party scene. Since 2018, Chokehole has been merging the camp aesthetics and culture of drag with the physicality of WWE-style wrestling. Chokehole is known for its humorous take on contemporary politics, its irreverent violence, and proof that gays not only bash back, they backflip. Chokehole has graced and stained the stages of Area 15 (Las Vegas), Kampnagel (Hamburg), Times Square Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and MoMA PS1, to humbly brag and name a few.\n![Hairbone](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/vgvol637/production/2a658938a833fb44cf73904ce345d50c9b258cc7-2634x1606.jpg?w=1000)\nHairbone Courtesy the artists\n**Hairbone** is a New York-based power trio composed of artists Ra√∫l de Nieves, Jessie Stead, and Nathan Whipple, formerly known as Haribo. Functioning mainly in the art world, Hairbone has inflicted their carnivalesque live shows upon audiences in museums to decrepit basements for nearly a decade. Each unique, narrative multimedia performance features frontman de Nieves inhabiting new personae in a sculptural actionist mode. Brandishing oversized, text-emblazoned props as if they were picket signs, de Nieves proceeds to destroy them as Hairbone‚Äôs near-opera burlesque freak show unfurls. Obliquely political, theirs is a protest music without didacticism.\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

An intimate, immersive live show, _Magic Hour_ features thoughtfully selected songs from the band‚Äôs first six albums: _The Fun Of Watching Fireworks_ , _From Our Living Room To Yours_ , _The Golden Band_ , _Know By Heart_ , _Promise Of Love_ , and _Set Free_. It‚Äôs also the band‚Äôs first proper show in nearly 20 years.\nFirst conceived in their hometown of Austin, Magic Hour features original members Andrew Kenny (guitar, vocals), Jesse Lee (bass), Tom Hoff (keys, guitar), Sean Ripple (vibes, vocals), and special guest Matthew Frank (drums, percussion). The show is presented in a fully seated, theatrical environment enhanced by immersive lighting and set design by Lisa Laratta (Paper Chairs). More than a carefully staged retrospective of the American Analog Set‚Äôs early discography, it‚Äôs something quieter, more intimate: a sonic memory book of the slowcore, post-rock, and lo-fi lullabies that defined a cult corner of American indie music from the late ‚Äô90s through the mid-2000s.\n**About the Artist**\nFormed in Austin in the mid-90s, the **American Analog Set** quietly became cult legends of American indie music with their distinctive blend of analog warmth, ambient textures, and minimalist pop restraint. Over six albums between 1996 and 2005, the band developed a sound that drew from German kosmische, ‚Äò90s slowcore, and home-recorded psychedelia‚Äîalways intimate, often hypnotic, and never in a rush.\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

Rooted in traditional polyphonic folk and layered with global influences, DakhaBrakha's spellbinding sound has captivated audiences around the world.\n**DakhaBrakha** is a music quartet comprised by musicians Marko Halanevych, Iryna Kovalenko, Olena Tsybulska, and Nina Garenetska from Kyiv, Ukraine. Their self-proclaimed ‚Äúethno chaos‚Äù sound spans years of performances prior to Russia‚Äôs 2022 invasion, but war is in everything now.

He had a cameo role in Jeff Nichols‚Äô _The Bikeriders_. BPB‚Äôs newest record is _The Purple Bird_(produced by David Ferguson), and features such giants of American music as John Anderson and Tim O‚ÄôBrien.\n  \n**Tashi Dorji** is a Bhutanese guitarist and improvisational musician known for his avant-garde and experimental approach to music.

With two performances scheduled over back-to-back evenings in the Main Hall, _The Woods_ celebrates the alchemical power of music and dance to transform fear and loss into life-affirming moments of community.\n_The Woods_ is Ludwig-Leone and Schumacher‚Äôs newest and perhaps most ambitious collaboration yet: exploding the rich musical universe of San Fermin‚Äôs catalogue across an enveloping set designed by **Jason Ardizzone-West**(_Redwood_ , The Weeknd, Dua Lipa). The set is visually inspired by an original sculpture by Ardizzone-West: a fractured frame with a snow white surface, belying something blood red and alive beneath. Featuring a cast of 17 dancers and singers moving freely across multiple stages and amongst the audience, the set becomes a living, breathing entity, while the band, situated throughout the space, puts the audience inside the music-making. Costumes by CFDA Award-winning fashion designer Elena Velez conjure a mythic dreamscape where fantasy and reality blur over the course of the 75 minute show. \nIn this production, the woods become a gathering place for searching souls awaiting a chance for change. Held together by this fragile connection, everyone who enters sees their own desires and fears written across the enchanted space, and as the sun sets, they are drawn deeper into a magical and sometimes perilous world.\nThe music of San Fermin, lauded for its ‚Äúknack for simultaneously expressing beauty and crisis,‚Äù lends itself to this expansive setting and theatrical treatment. What is the role of storytelling‚Äîand songwriting‚Äîin a constantly shifting, often terrifying reality? _The Woods_ celebrates the alchemical power of music and dance to transform fear and loss into life-affirming and communal experiences: in a world that is always in motion, we must resolve to love.\nIn this spirit, _The Woods_ is meant to be undertaken in a crowd. Drawing on elements of a live rock concert, theater, and contemporary dance, _The Woods_ promises to be a singular and unforgettable event.  \n  \n**CREATIVE TEAM**\n**Troy Schumacher,** Co-Creator, Director & Choreographer  \n**Ellis Ludwig-Leone** , Co-Creator, Composer & Music Director  \n**Jason Ardizzone-West,** Stage Designer & Source Artist  \n**Elena Velez** , Costume Designer  \n**Vivian Chuang** , Stylist  \n**Ben Rawson** , Lighting Designer  \n**DJ Potts** , Sound Designer  \n**Zach Jenkins** , Stage Manager  \n**Matthew Stephens,** Rehearsal Vocal Coach  \n**Marzia Memoli** , Rehearsal Director   \n**Lorenzo Pagano** , Rehearsal Director  \n**Philip Nix** ,  \n**Meyrem Bulucek** , Campaign Photographer  \n  \n**SAN FERMIN**  \nEllis Ludwig-Leone  \nAllen Tate  \nClaire Wellin  \nStephen Chen  \nTyler McDiarmid  \nGriffin Brown  \n  \n**FEATURED PERFORMERS**  \nMckenzie Cahill, Lead Vocalist  \nAnnalise Gehling  \nSophie Rose Shapiro  \nThomas Hogan  \nMizuho Kappa  \nLeslie Andrea Williams  \n  \n**ENSEMBLE PERFORMERS**  \nArcadian Broad  \nJustin Daniels  \nShizu Higa  \nSalma Kiuhan  \nDevin Loh  \nSolange Rodrigues  \nNoah Wang  \nAnnika Wong  \n  \n**ADDITIONAL MUSICIANS**  \nColin Brookes  \nAndy Clausen  \nLauren Cauley Kalal  \nAddison Maye-Saxon\n#### The Woods _is presented by Pioneer Works in collaboration with BalletCollective & San Fermin.

In this region of old farms and prehistoric caves, Sadie becomes entranced by a mysterious figure named Bruno Lacombe, a mentor to the young activists who believes that the path to emancipation is not revolt but a return to the ancient past. Sadie is certain she‚Äôs the seductress and puppet master of those she surveils. But Bruno is seducing her with his ingenious counter-histories, his artful laments, his own tragic story.\nRachel Kushner has become one of our most iconic and influential contemporary writers: her cherished novels on art and motorcycles, politics and prisons, have traveled from Cuba to California to Red Guards-era Italy to the ancient caves and anarchist collectives of _Creation Lake_ ‚Äîa noir fiction that‚Äôs taut, dazzling, and replete with high comedy and high art alike.\nFor this special Author Talk during Second Sundays, Kushner will be in conversation with PW‚Äôs Director of Publishing, Joshua Jelly-Schapiro. Books will be available for sale, and a signing with the writer will follow her talk.\n**Rachel Kushner** is the author of the _New York Times_ bestseller _Creation Lake_ , her latest novel; _The Hard Crowd_ , her acclaimed essay collection; and the internationally bestselling novels _The Mars Room_ , _The Flamethrowers_ , and _Telex from Cuba_ , as well as a book of short stories, _The Strange Case of Rachel K_. She has won the Prix M√©dicis and been a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Folio Prize, and was twice a finalist for the Booker Prize and the National Book Award in Fiction. _Creation Lake_ was also longlisted for the National Book Award.

Have a question about this performance? Please email****guestservices@grammymuseum.org****.**\n**ABOUT YUNGBLUD**\nYungblud AKA Dominic Harrison is the 27-year-old from Doncaster who has achieved two UK number-one albums, generated six billion Spotify streams globally, and broken into the Billboard Top 100 with his last two albums.\nIn 2024, Yungblud debuted his own festival, Bludfest, at The National Bowl in Milton Keynes, where he presented a curated lineup of artists, headlining the bill himself. That same year, he released You Need to Exist: A Book to Love and Destroy on Penguin Publishing, which became an instant No.1 Sunday Times Bestseller.\nThis summer, Yungblud will release his fourth studio album, _IDOLS_.\nOn **_IDOLS,_ Yungblud **explores the theme of hero-worship; how we look to others for validation, often putting others‚Äô lives on a pedestal at the expense of the richness of our own experiences. **Yungblud** says, ‚Äú _We turn to others for an identity before turning to ourselves. Self-belief, self-reclamation, self-evolution and change. As we grow up, we lose our belief in magic and mystery. We begin to rationalize everything; our cage walls build up._ ‚Äù He added, ‚Äú _We compare ourselves to 15 different people before we‚Äôve even had our breakfast_ ‚Äù.**‚Äç**\n‚Äç**  \nABOUT _YUNGBLUD. ARE YOU READY, BOY?_**\nThe feature-length documentary, directed by three-time**Grammy Award-nominated** ,**Emmy¬Æ** and **BAFTA-** winning filmmaker**Paul Dugdale** (_Adele: One Night Only_ , _Elton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium_ , _The Prodigy 'Worlds on Fire‚Äô_ , _Glastonbury Festival: Live at Worthy Farm_) was shot at the legendary **Hansa Studios Building** in **Berlin** , the birthplace of **David Bowie** ‚Äôs **_Heroes,_** **U2‚Äôs _Achtung Baby!_** and countless other iconic albums.\nA personal journey of change, confidence and rock-and-roll chaos, set against a city that has always celebrated counterculture and creativity, **_YUNGBLUD. ARE YOU READY, BOY?_** is a revealing and uncompromising documentary about a generational artist finding his own voice.\nPresented in B&W and colour, including stunning sequences shot in 16mm, the two-hour-long documentary shows **Yungblud** at a pivotal moment in his career. The film follows the artist as he relocates to the historic Berlin studio with his band to record live performances of tracks from his brand-new album, **_Idols_** , for the very first time. His most personal record to date, **_Idols_** was released in June 2025 to critical acclaim, becoming **Yungblud‚Äôs** third consecutive no. 1 album in the UK. With cameras rolling throughout the entire process and no live audience present, the project removes any artifice, presenting a truthful and unapologetic behind-the-scenes look at the creative process and the performances in its purest form, highlighting the intimate relationships and dynamic between Dom, the band and the music.\n# Sep 15\n# The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud\n# UPCOMING\n##### [Sep 9 Just Mustard ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/just-mustard)\n##### [Sep 12 Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith Present Disiniblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/rachika-nayar-and-nina-keith-present-disiniblud)\n##### [Sep 16 Devendra Banhart (Solo) with support from Kath Bloom ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/devendra-banhart-solo-with-support-from-kath-bloom-9-16)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":"The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud","start_date":"2025-09-15","end_date":"2025-09-15","start_time":"19:30","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"80 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249","image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e9663cdcd7c08673a4b3788/5e96671be408a4055c6fc337_asset%200.png","description":"Yungblud to perform at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, NY for a special live performance.","event_type":"Show","topics":["Music"],"source_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/performances","detail_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/the-grammy-museum-presents-a-new-york-evening-with-yungblud"}}

He was born Devendra Obi Banhart in Houston, Texas, but spent his childhood in Caracas, Venezuela; as a teenager, his family returned to the States, relocating in Southern California, where he soon became enamored of skateboard culture. \nMusic was always a passion for Banhart, and he discovered it in ways both magical and haphazard. As a boy in Caracas, says Banhart, ‚ÄúI was surrounded by salsa, merengue, cumbia, some bossa nova‚Äîthat was ubiquitous, you‚Äôd hear it on any street.‚Äù In high school, Banhart became obsessed with rocksteady, bluebeat, and ska, which he‚Äôd learned about via skateboarding videos. Finishing high school, he thought he would pursue a visual arts career so he enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute, but he soon dropped out in favor of exploring music. He has, however, successfully maintained a parallel career as a visual artist: Banhart‚Äôs distinctive, minutely inked, often enigmatic drawings have appeared in galleries all over the world, including the Art Basel Contemporary Art Fair in Miami; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels; and Los Angeles‚Äô Museum of Contemporary Art and Nicodim Gallery.\nSan Francisco had an indelible influence on Banhart; the flamboyant dressing he adopted that entranced the fashion crowd (and fueled the ‚Äúfreak folk‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Weird America‚Äù labels the press attached to him) was inspired in part by the seriously subversive cross-dressing culture of San Francisco‚Äôs legendary performance troupe the Cockettes.\nLike former label-mates Caetano Veloso and David Byrne, Banhart has embraced an astonishingly wide range of musical ideas, from folk to blues to the avant garde. He extols the late Arthur Russell, a relentlessly eclectic artist who was impossible to pigeonhole in his brief lifetime, and Banhart has brought back into the spotlight forgotten artists like late-‚Äô60s singer Vashti Bunyan, whose psychedelic folk he championed. He has collaborated with Brazilian legends Os Mutantes, the Swans, ANOHNI, and Beck, among others, and has engaged in art projects like conceptualist Doug Aitken‚Äôs monumental 2012 Song 1 video installation on the fa√ßade of the Hirschhorn Museum in Washington, DC.\nFor Banhart, his career remains ‚Äúan adventure and an exploration.‚Äù Banhart admits, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really take care of my voice, but, just like with playing guitar, you get more familiar with it, and you get better at it. I‚Äôve always said that I‚Äôm very good at not knowing how to play the guitar but, really, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm very comfortable with the utter uncertainty of my approach.‚Äù\n* * *\n**This is a standing room-only performance.

She comes from a special place where country, blues and folk are made beautifully translucent and emotive. Highly regarded but a bit of a mystery. The Connecticut based singer/songwriter has a special gift - her almost supernaturally beautiful, wavering soprano is one that has to be heard, she has a clear transparent moonlight tone combined with an earthly raw quality that can silence a room. \nKath made some very very limited edition albums in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs with the amazing (and equally dreamlike) guitarist Loren Mazzacane Connors, full of songs that float and melt into the ether. Impossibly beautiful. However, music was put on the back burner as life changed and she raised a family, trained ‚Äòproblem horses‚Äô and taught special music programs to kids. Just as she was starting to write and release CDs again, Richard Linklater decided to use her song ‚ÄòCome Here‚Äô in his 1995 film ‚ÄòBefore Sunrise‚Äô. Life altered - not much - but the public consciousness was rightfully tweaked. Slowly her old recordings and new material have been seeping back into the world. This includes a special tribute album by artists such as Josephine Foster, Bill Callahan, Devendra Banhart, Meg Baird and Scout Nibblet. Since 2017 she has been recording and performing with New Haven, CT based guitarist David Shapiro.\n# Sep 16\n# Devendra Banhart (Solo) with support from Kath Bloom\n# UPCOMING\n##### [Sep 9 Just Mustard ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/just-mustard)\n##### [Sep 12 Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith Present Disiniblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/rachika-nayar-and-nina-keith-present-disiniblud)\n##### [Sep 15 The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/the-grammy-museum-presents-a-new-york-evening-with-yungblud)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":"Devendra Banhart (Solo) with support from Kath Bloom","start_date":"2025-09-16","end_date":"2025-09-16","start_time":"19:30","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"National Sawdust, Brooklyn, NY","image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e96671be408a4055c6fc337_asset%200.png","description":"Devendra Banhart b. 1980, Houston, Texas lives and works in Los Angeles.

Wauters explored the excitement of falling back in love with his birthplace on his subsequent record, 2023‚Äôs Wandering Rebel, but on his seventh studio album MVD LUV ‚Äî due June 27 via Captured Tracks ‚Äî Wauters doesn‚Äôt just introduce listeners to Montevideo; he invites them to feel at home within it. Having spent much of his career in the United States, Wauters has long carried the dual identity of immigrant and native son. With MVD LUV, a love letter to both his roots and his present, he set out to bridge those worlds by capturing the essence of Montevideo‚Äôs streets and communal spirit.\nLIVE AT NATIONAL SAWDUST // DOORS AT 6:30PM\nSeptember 26, 2025\n7:30 pm\n[BUY TICKETS](https://ci.ovationtix.com/36490/production/1237015)\nThis event has passed\n![facebook sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/facebook.svg)\n![twitter sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/twitter.svg)\n![pinterest sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/pinterest.svg)\n![sharethis sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/sharethis.svg)\n## What‚Äôs a Rich Text element?\nThe rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually.

[Voila!](http://google.com)\n#### How to customize formatting for each rich text\nHeadings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich text element using the \"When inside of\" nested selector system.\nWith _MVD LUV_ , a love letter to both his roots and his present, he set out to bridge those worlds by capturing the essence of Montevideo‚Äôs streets and communal spirit. Wauters recorded the album between January and October 2024 in various locations across the city, from his own JPW Studios to bustling sidewalks, rooftops, and the homes of featured artists. Having worked in the past with US-based indie favorites like Frankie Cosmos, Mac DeMarco, and Nick Hakim, _MVD LUV_ fills out Wauters‚Äô performances with a crew of local musicians including co-producer Leandro Aquistapacie, Mateo Ottonello, Cecilia ‚ÄúChecha‚Äù Rodr√≠guez, and Manuel Silva. Wauters mixed and mastered the record with Nicol√°s Demczylo at Los Aliados Estudio. Together, these all-Uruguayan artists blend Wauters‚Äô rootsy brand of delightfully simple folk-pop with traditional elements emblematic of the country. Songs like the lively ‚ÄúLa Luc√≠a‚Äù introduces listeners to candombe, a communal music and dance tradition; recorded spontaneously, it feels less like a studio track and more like a snapshot of a real-life encounter. Meanwhile, \"Aeropuerto\" and \"Siempre Vuelven\" evoke sentimentality through murga rhythms, another traditional style of drum-heavy music that‚Äôs prominent in Uruguayan culture. The result is immediately immersive, the sprawling coastal city of Montevideo becoming more than just a setting. On _MVD LUV_ , the city is an active presence in the music, a character in itself.\n* * *\n**This is a standing room-only performance. If you require accessibility accommodations, please email boxoffice@nationalsawdust.org.**\nThere‚Äôs a sort of pressure you can feel when returning to your hometown after a stint away; you want to be the best version of you, with some tangible evidence that you‚Äôve made a name for yourself. Wauters has no doubt achieved that. But he‚Äôs just as susceptible to self-doubt as anyone, and on songs like ‚ÄúDime Amiga,‚Äù he begins to fully realize the safety net of unconditional love he‚Äôs built for himself, layering conversational lyrics over a warm, rhythmic arrangement: ‚ÄúTell me friend, how are you?/Tell me, why are you crying?‚Äù he asks in Spanish, spotlighting the power of being fully honest in a place that wholeheartedly accepts you as you are. As years pass and relationships and communities evolve, Wauters suggests, there may be a lingering fear that your place of origin will one day feel foreign. But, as he also exhorts on _MVD LUV_ : ‚ÄùThere are times to fly and get lost and there are also times to return.‚Äù Wherever you are, music and love can often make you feel right at home. On _MVD LUV_ , Wauters brings his home, Uruguay, to the global stage.\n[MVD LUV is out June 27 on Captured Tracks.](https://juanwauters.ffm.to/mvdluv.opr)\n# Sep 26\n# Juan Wauters\n# UPCOMING\n##### [Sep 9 Just Mustard ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/just-mustard)\n##### [Sep 12 Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith Present Disiniblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/rachika-nayar-and-nina-keith-present-disiniblud)\n##### [Sep 15 The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/the-grammy-museum-presents-a-new-york-evening-with-yungblud)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":"Juan Wauters","start_date":"2025-09-26","end_date":"2025-09-26","start_time":"19:30","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"80 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249","image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e9663cdcd7c08673a4b3788/5e96671be408a4055c6fc337_asset%200.png","description":"Juan Wauters performs at National Sawdust on September 26, 2025.","event_type":"Show","topics":["Performing Arts","Music"],"source_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/performances","detail_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/juan-wauters"}}

With music as a backbone, he started as a drummer from a young age, soon picking up the guitar and piano. His love and study of music and instruments expanded further to natural sounds and recording during his college years. This led to studying the musicality of all sounds and applying studio recording techniques and practices in remote and rugged natural locations through extensive work with Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and percussionist Susie Ibarra. Together, Landau and Ibarra have recorded music and natural soundscapes‚Äîfresh water, glaciers, birdsongs, oceans, trees‚Äîin the Sikkim and Indian Himalayas, Moroccan Sahara, and in UNESCO Sites Do√±ana National Park in Spain and Jasmund National Park on the Baltic Sea in Germany. Inspired by the visually stunning aspects of these places, Landau began documenting them with photography as well. He has released close to ten Splice Sound Packs with Ibarra, including _Migration, Memories: Melancholy Pop,_ and _Heart_ _and Breath: Ambient Hypnotic_ with Ibarra and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire. He has also engineered and spatialized surround sound installations for Ibarra‚Äôs _Water Rhythms: Listening to Climate Change_ , shown at the San Francisco Exploratorium, TED Climate Countdown, and Arko Art Center in Seoul, among other places.

For over 25 years, Cochemea has built a distinct career as a soloist, section player, and composer/ arranger, collaborating with artists across genres‚Äî from his long tenure with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings to work with Kevin Morby, Run The Jewels, Jon Batiste, Amy Winehouse, The Roots, Archie Shepp, Mark Ronson, and Quincy Jones, among many others. \nHis forthcoming album on Daptone Records, Vol. 3: Ancestros Futuros, is the third volume in a series that includes All My Relations (2019) and Vol. 2: Baca Sewa (2021). Across his body of work, Cochemea interweaves the past, present, and future, engaging with time as speculative history‚Äî one that moves fluidly between memory and possibility. \nFor Vol. 3: Ancestros Futuros, he gathered a core group of longtime collaborators‚Äîa powerhouse octet of New York City percussionists and members of Daptone‚Äôs famed rhythm section. Gabriel Roth (aka Bosco Mann) returned as producer and mixing engineer, capturing the band live to 8-track analog tape. Accompanied by a 9-minute film mixed in Dolby Atmos, this volume also marks Cochemea‚Äôs evolution into visual storytelling. \nCochemea‚Äôs previous releases have been praised by DJs and critics alike. His Daptone debut, All My Relations, was a family reunion of sorts, uniting spirits, musicians, and melodies across time and place. Leading a nine-piece ensemble, he recombined ancient elements‚Äî drums, winds, and voice‚Äîinto a deeply personal meditation on the interconnection of all things. Vol. 2: Baca Sewa directed this exploration into the archives of family history, mythology, and the cultural imaginary. Pitchfork called All My Relations ‚Äúequal parts spiritual journey and irrepressible funk.‚Äù Mojo awarded the album four stars, noting ‚Äúits message of harmony and oneness is universal,‚Äù while Downbeat described Vol. 2: Baca Sewa as ‚Äúradiating like a flower from beginning to end.‚Äù \nVol. 3: Ancestros Futuros is anchored in the cultural fabric that has nurtured Cochemea from the beginning. A California native of Yaqui ancestry, Cochemea describes a central part of his work as ‚Äúaccessing ancestral memory that comes in different forms‚Äîsometimes when you visit a place, sometimes in dreams... it‚Äôs in our DNA. For me, it‚Äôs about seeking wholeness in these zones of fracture.‚Äù \nDreams play a vital role in his creative process. ‚ÄúA lot of melodies come to me through dreams,‚Äù he shares. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept a record of them for years, shaping the language into dream scores as foundations for compositions that connect the conscious and unconscious realm.‚Äù One such score appears on the back cover of Ancestros Futuros, reflecting the intuitive and layered nature of his work. This dream guided approach informs the album‚Äôs opening track, TransmisioÃÅn del SonÃÉar, which serves as a portal between dimensions. \nThe album is also shaped by stories of survival and resistance. The title track, Ancestros Futuros, draws from a story of a Yaqui midwife who would bury the navels of newborns in the ground so that future generations would rise and reclaim the land. ‚ÄúI was thinking about survival as a continuum connecting past and future generations,‚Äù Cochemea explains, a theme that echoes throughout his compositions. \nCochemea‚Äôs musical and spiritual synthesis is made possible through his reverence for the horn and the music and traditions that precede him. His distinct voice as a saxophonist and flutist places him within a lineage of players who honor the past while blending dexterity with invention. Inspired by heroes like Eddie Harris, Yusef Lateef, Jim Pepper, and Gato Barbieri, he coaxes his instruments into intimate and expressive realms, bridging ancestral rhythmic traditions with forward-looking vision, creating a signature sound that is both deeply rooted and expansive. \nVol. 3: Ancestros Futuros finds Cochemea building worlds of sound, blending past, present, and future into a ritual offering‚Äîan evolving sonic fiction carried across space-time, where memory, survival, and imagination converge. \n# Oct 11\n# Cochemea - Vol 3: Ancestros Futuros LP Release Show\n# UPCOMING\n##### [Sep 9 Just Mustard ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/just-mustard)\n##### [Sep 12 Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith Present Disiniblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/rachika-nayar-and-nina-keith-present-disiniblud)\n##### [Sep 15 The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/the-grammy-museum-presents-a-new-york-evening-with-yungblud)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":"Cochemea - Vol 3: Ancestros Futuros LP Release Show","start_date":"2025-10-11","end_date":"2025-10-11","start_time":"19:00","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"80 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249","image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e9663cdcd7c08673a4b3788/5e96671be408a4055c6fc337_asset%200.png","description":"Join us for an evening with psychedelic jazz visionary Cochemea, celebrating the release of his latest album ‚ÄúVol 3: Ancestros Futuros‚Äù.

The new self-titled album is a testament to almost twenty years of shared musical sensibility, now distilled into its barest elements. The album paints an intimate, exaggerated portrait of NYC, a cacophony of jagged post-punk, funk, and dance beats giving way to lush strings and spacious minimalism. It‚Äôs a sound that is both resilient and reflective, proving that even as the city and the band evolve, Ava Luna continue to take listeners somewhere urgent and new. \nLIVE AT NATIONAL SAWDUST // DOORS AT 6:30PM\nOctober 18, 2025\n7:30 pm\n[BUY TICKETS](https://ci.ovationtix.com/36490/production/1246126)\nThis event has passed\n![facebook sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/facebook.svg)\n![twitter sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/twitter.svg)\n![pinterest sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/pinterest.svg)\n![sharethis sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/sharethis.svg)\n## What‚Äôs a Rich Text element?\nThe rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually.

This deliberate focus on the rhythm section ensures that the songs can stand strongly in their most stripped-down format before any additional layers are introduced. At the same time, Carlos and Felicia deliver a meticulous and thoughtful style of vocal interplay that moves beyond traditional lead and backup roles. Their voices dance, weave, and harmonize, often blending into a singular, almost supernatural entity.\nAn extended lineup for the album release celebration at National Sawdust brings the recorded arrangements to life.

Called at various times ‚Äúquirky and confident, mysterious and compelling‚Äù (_The Village Voice_), ‚Äúpost-soul‚Ä¶pulsating from one energy to another, suggesting art project and ritual‚Äù (_New York Times_), and ‚Äúlocated somewhere between the control of modern R&B and the staccato angles of the art punk scene‚Äù (_NME_), the band has defied categorization through many changes in lineup and genre experiments through five full-length LPs. The common thread is fun hooky melodies, angular textures, infectious grooves, unexpected forms, and intimate worldbuilding. Since the late 2000s, Ava Luna has been a staple in NYC‚Äôs DIY music scene, and has built a reputation for exhilarating live shows, even as the quartet individually stay active as prolific producers, collaborators (YATTA, Helado Negro, Dirty Projectors, Youbet, Toro Y Moi, Tony Seltzer, Juan Wauters, Ben√©t, Palehound, to name a few), educators, and performers in their own right.\n‚Äç\n**ABOUT AMIRTHA KIDAMBI'S ELDER ONES**\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/6894de75d22ed247052e153b_EO5tetcolor2_DSF1210_webres%20by%20Caroline%20Harrison%20\\(2\\).jpg)\nAmirtha Kidambi‚Äôs Elder Ones pushes the boundaries of free jazz, composition and electronic forms, with the raw riotous energy of \"spiritual punk\" confronting and resisting systems of oppression and control through their music. This time, the Elder Ones collective consists of soprano saxophonist Matt Nelson (Lydia Lunch Retrovirus), tenor saxophonist Alfredo Colon (Henry Threadgill, Moses Sumney), bassist Lester St. Louis (jaimie branch‚Äôs Fly or Die, HxH), and drummer Jason Nazary (Wrens, Saint Abdullah)‚Äîall of whom contribute their share of electronic textures and electroacoustic treatments. Kidambi‚Äôs voice hovers over a scorched sonic landscape equally informed by Black American liberation music, the devotional fervor of Indian Carnatic, and the unleashing of an inner scream listeners might associate with hardcore punk and harsh noise. To be sure, the propulsive presence of repetition, mantra, and call-and-response patterns instantly elicit a protest at its peak, and what remains is an ensemble ecology that fluctuates between consonance and collision. The subversive spirit and sense of collectiveness cultivated during mass demonstrations across New York City in the wake of the tragic murder of George Floyd serves as the driving force behind their latest album _New Monuments_. Kidambi describes the title as a metaphor for tearing down old colonial monuments, paving the way for the rebuilding of new symbols of collective liberation. As a document of dissent, these four compositions give proof that improvisation is instrumental in the realm of resistance.\n‚Äç\n**ABOUT BEN√âT**\n![BENET-27.jpg__PID:19c6f5fb-f6e6-44b1-911f-f86f725a6256](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/689b7e92656a1a95526469d4_BENET-27.jpeg)\n'Ben√©t thinks of his new indie rock album, Make ‚ÄòEm Laugh, as a game of Clue. He‚Äôs trying to map out exactly when and how a relationship failed. ‚ÄúI was left behind romantically and I was really feeling that,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI was wondering, ‚ÄòAm I going to be okay?‚Äô How did I get to a place where we‚Äôre not cool? Was it all me?‚Äô‚Äù You can certainly hear moments of heartache, resentment, and regret on Make ‚ÄòEm Laugh. On ‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù he fixates on how much he misses someone, and on ‚ÄúNeed,‚Äù he comes to terms with the realization that a partner can‚Äôt meet his emotional needs. But despite these moments of pain, a sense of soaring optimism drives the album forward. Make ‚ÄòEm Laugh is a document of discovery and self-realization, and is full of questions rather than answers. Open-hearted inquiry is a skill he learned in therapy, which he started going to while working on the project. ‚ÄúYou're not going to know everything,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis world does not give you cheat sheet answers. But as long as you know what you want to know, you can get a bit of freedom from just asking.‚Äù Ben√©t worked with longterm collaborator Carlos Truly on 'Make 'Em Laugh', in which Carlos was the main collaborator and co-writer throughout the record.Contemplative guitar ballad ‚ÄúWonder‚Äù opens the record. Ben√©t asks if ‚Äúgoodbye will ever sound nice‚Äù and if ‚Äúmy mom and dad will ever be friends.‚Äù The song also samples audio of other people sharing their own inquiries - if they will be in love forever, if they should have done more for themselves when they were younger. Despite the angst expressed, it‚Äôs a life-affirming moment that shows just how similar all of our worries are. ‚ÄúDid you know I got questions? Don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm guessing,‚Äù Faye Webster croons on ‚ÄúMake ‚ÄòEm Laugh,‚Äù the song she features on. She sings about a relationship that topples her understanding of love, leaving her with an exciting new perspective on the world. And on the balmy, free-flowing track ‚ÄúBird‚Äôs Eye View,‚Äù Ben√©t‚Äôs voice weaves through flute trills, meandering keys, and bird song as he contemplates how to cultivate lasting inner peace. He never lands on an answer, but the propulsion and glimmer of the music offers reassurance that happiness might be within reach. Ben√©t‚Äôs ability to traverse many complex and conflicting emotional states informs the sound of the music too: the album is dynamic, vibrant, and genre fluid. His warm vocals shine on contemplative indie-rock tracks like ‚ÄúPieces Of Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemon.‚Äù On ‚ÄúToo Scared to Say,‚Äù he employs autotune to convey a sense of swirling confusion, a sentiment that intensifies on experimental electronic track ‚ÄúSlimmer.‚Äù Ben√©t and featured singer AnnonXL trade off verses as the production transforms from crystalline and gentle to thrillingly noisy and energized. After graduating from high school in 2017, Ben√©t got a job as (incredibly) a trombone player in a clown band at an amusement park. He met a lot of musicians at the gig, but still didn‚Äôt consider making music himself. It wasn‚Äôt until 2020, when his friend Jason Garland released a song, that Ben√©t realized it was possible for him to be an independent local artist too. He hit up Cameron Smith, the person who produced Jason‚Äôs song, and they worked on a track together called ‚ÄúFunny,‚Äù which gained traction and caught the attention of indie label Bayonet Records. Bayonet asked him if he had more tracks they could hear. He told them he did (he didn‚Äôt) and headed to the studio for a few weeks to write the music that would become his 2021 EP Game Over! In 2023, he released his debut album, Can I go again, also with Bayonet..Ben√©t also really enjoyed working with the artists featured on the album. He discovered Margaux‚Äôs music when she performed at the Brooklyn venue Baby‚Äôs All Right, where he works, and was excited to realize that fans had already been connecting their work in the YouTube comments on his videos. Faye Webster is his best friend, and someone who he feels matches his aptitude for asking astute questions about relationships. And AnnonXL‚Äôs whirling, vibrant verse on ‚ÄúSlimmer‚Äù was so good that it pushed Ben√©t creatively. ‚ÄúWhen AnnonXL sent their verse in, I hadn‚Äôt finished the second part of the song yet,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI heard what they sent and was like, ‚ÄòOh, I gotta go harder!‚Äô‚ÄùMake ‚ÄòEm Laugh may have begun as a way to process a breakup, but, as a body of work, it looks far beyond the specifics of just one relationship. This is music that wonders about the big life questions that connect us all and that finds solace in community.

Founded in 2016 by composers Missy Mazzoli and Ellen Reid, Luna Composition Lab provides mentorship, education, and resources for young female, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming composers ages 13 to 18. Luna Composition Lab is the only initiative of its kind in the United States and has achieved national recognition.\nLuna Lab believes that an equitable and inclusive music community that empowers artists to develop an authentic form of expression will create a more vibrant field of music. By fostering a supportive, sustained, and professional community with young composers who are female, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming, Luna Lab provides a model of inclusivity and artistic excellence for the field as a whole so that it can better reflect the society in which we live. \nThe coming year ‚Äì 2026 ‚Äì marks the tenth anniversary of Luna Lab‚Äôs founding. Throughout the season, Luna Lab@10 will celebrate the success of our fellows through 50+ alumni commissions with collaborating organizations across the country, including the LA Phil, San Francisco Girls Chorus, Louisville Symphony, and New York Festival of Song.\n‚Äç\n**LUNA COMPOSITION LAB STAFF**\nAlyssa Kayser-Hirsh, Executive Director  \nMissy Mazzoli, Co-Founder & Artistic Director  \nEllen Reid, Co-Founder & Artistic Director  \nNicki Sekhar, Program Manager  \nJanet Cowperthwaite, Strategic Initiatives Consultant\n‚Äç\n**ABOUT ChamberQUEER**\nHailed as ‚Äúa utopian dream‚Ä¶ [at] the cutting-edge of classical music‚Äù _(The Nation)_ , **ChamberQUEER** highlights LGBTQ+ voices in contemporary & historical music and reimagines the classical concert experience as a radically inclusive gathering space & musical community for the 21st century. Founded in 2018 by Jules Biber (cello), Danielle Buonaiuto (soprano), Brian Mummert (baritone), and Andrew Yee (cello), CQ operates as a collective of performers, composers, and creators. Our flagship annual Pride festival, staged in Brooklyn each June, has been commended by _The New Yorker_ and listed by _The New York Times_ as a 2022 ‚ÄúBest of Pride‚Äù event; 2024‚Äôs fringe-style festival, _Constellation_ , featured twenty-one events over six days, showcasing the voices of dozens of LGBTQ+ musicians from around the globe.\nChamberQUEER interrogates and experiments with, or ‚Äúqueers,‚Äù European art music‚Äôs presumed necessities and existing norms. By crafting new narratives from the canon, democratizing performance etiquette and dress, and shattering the performer-audience binary, we create a fresh an d inviting environment for a new generation of music lovers. Recent projects emphasizing these values have included collaboratively-curated concerts with alumnae of Luna Composition Lab; a concert and talk-back with LGBTQ+ students at Boston College; presentations on equity and belonging at Chamber Music America and Early Music America‚Äôs national conferences; and shows presented by National Sawdust, WQXR at the Greene Space, Death of Classical at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn Pride, Trinity Wall Street, the Boulanger Initiative, Classical Uprising, and Westerlies Fest.

Her new album, _The Life You Save_ , takes that a step further; put simply, it‚Äôs the most honest, intimate and personally revealing record of Wasner‚Äôs career. As heart-wrenching as they are hopeful, its twelve tracks delve the depths of addiction and codependency, inherited and experienced trauma, and the process of finding peace in the face of others‚Äô suffering. _The Life You Save_ is resonant, unflinchingly exposed ‚Äì like a missive from the eye of a storm. But while it somehow manages to feel both viscerally raw and vulnerable, above it floats a sense of quiet peace, a sheen of hindsight, or perhaps of acceptance. It is the story of how it feels to be trapped between two worlds‚Äîthe one you came from, and the one you‚Äôve escaped to; about the belief that somehow, you can take the ones you love with you to this place; about the grief of realizing that the only person you can save is yourself.\n‚Äç _The Life You Save_ was produced by Jenn Wasner and recorded at Betty‚Äôs in Chapel Hill, NC, and Montrose Recording in Los Angeles, CA, and includes the highlights ‚ÄúLong After Midnight,‚Äù ‚ÄúDefeat,‚Äù ‚ÄúAfraid,‚Äù ‚ÄúKeep Me In The Dark,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRiver In My Arms.‚Äù _The Life You Save_ also features additional production from Nick Sanborn (tracks 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11), is engineered by Adrian Olsen & Alli Rogers, mixed by Adrian Olsen, and mastered by Huntley Miller.\nJenn writes on _‚Äç_** _The Life You Save_** _was produced by Jenn Wasner and recorded at Betty‚Äôs in Chapel Hill, NC, and Montrose Recording in Los Angeles, CA, and includes the highlights ‚ÄúLong After Midnight,‚Äù ‚ÄúDefeat,‚Äù ‚ÄúAfraid,‚Äù ‚ÄúKeep Me In The Dark,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRiver In My Arms.‚Äù_** _The Life You Save_** _also features additional production from Nick Sanborn (tracks 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11), is engineered by Adrian Olsen & Alli Rogers, mixed by Adrian Olsen, and mastered by Huntley Miller._:\n‚ÄúMy previous records, generally, have been a summary of things I had already been through‚Äî experiences I had observed and reflected upon, reporting back from some amount of distance. But this record is different. It is an attempt to report from inside of a process that is ongoing and unfinished, from which I will likely never fully emerge as long as I am alive: my struggle within the cycles of addiction and co-dependency.   \n\n‚ÄúI set out trying to make a record about _other_ people.  \n\n_‚ÄúTheir_ problems,_their_ struggles, _their_ addictions.  \n\n‚ÄúI struggled for many years to give myself permission to write about this subject‚Äìworried that I was telling someone else‚Äôs story, a story that was not mine to tell. The work felt hazy and obscured; I was confused, and I struggled. The beauty of songwriting, at its best, is that it puts you in touch with your subconscious‚Äìa place where you can only tell the truth. Many of those truths were hard to accept. Some I don‚Äôt, even now, feel fully ready to say. But through this process, I came to understand that I was struggling with this record because I wasn‚Äôt being honest with myself. I was so deeply entrenched in the system in which I was raised that I thought I was outside of it, and the ways in which I continued to participate remained invisible to me.  \n\n‚ÄúBut slowly, painstakingly, through this work I began to realize‚ÄîI am not _apart_ from all of this. I have been performing my role from a distance, but I am still engaged, still connected:  \n\n_‚ÄúI‚Äôm inside it, after all._\n‚ÄúAs it turns out, this record is not someone else‚Äôs story‚Äìit is mine, the story of my life. A life spent believing I had escaped, and that I deserved to feel guilty for doing so. A life in which I believed that the right combination of words, actions, effort, and expense could somehow change others‚Äô behavior. And a life in which blindness to my own patterns caused me to hurt others, and prevented me from finding the true love and acceptance I yearned for.   \n\n‚ÄúThe belief that you can rescue others comes from more than one place, internally speaking. The part that is easiest to see and acknowledge is the one that stems from love, good intentions, and a genuine desire to offer care and support. But there‚Äôs an uglier side, and that part is harder to look at‚Äîthe ego, the pridefulness, the belief that you are better, stronger, somehow more deserving than all the rest. That through your attempts to control others‚Äô behavior, you can somehow secure a sense of safety for yourself.   \n\n_‚ÄúI know the rules, but I ignore them,_\n_I think I‚Äôm good enough to pull this off._  \n\n‚ÄúOr, more simply:   \n\n_‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm god; I know I‚Äôm not._  \n\n‚ÄúFor me, that was the puzzle piece that finally made it all make sense. But it was also the piece that was the hardest to hold. It took a long time for me to build up enough love‚Äînot for others, but for myself‚Äîthat acknowledging this truth would not break me. I understand now that I‚Äôm not the savior, not the hero, not the chosen one. I‚Äôm spinning in my own wheel, a bundle of addictions and adaptations and blind spots, just like everybody else. And there is a beauty to that, along with a kind of freedom.   \n\nIn the end, it is my hope that this record exists as a testament to the depth of my love for those I cannot save, and that it might provide some comfort for anyone who is still learning how to love and live for themselves.\n‚Äç\n‚Äç**ABOUT NATALIE JANE HILL**\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/68b848b21523228bc1d54243_NJH%20.jpeg)\nNatalie Jane Hill is a Texas native guitarist and singer-songwriter currently based in the mountains of North Carolina.

Named after a line from Catherine‚Äôs university dissertation on gender inequality in the music industry, the project challenges narrow definitions of jazz while spotlighting the genre‚Äôs often-overlooked barriers. Across its tracks, BOLDEN. blends live jazz performance with house, all while questioning who gets to define what jazz is and who gets to participate in it.

We treat sound as a living, porous medium shaped by genre-defiance, interdisciplinary dialogue, and the urgency of the present moment. We believe that music, as a cultural medium, fills the role of the ‚Äúblack box,‚Äù enacting an ambiguous but vital relationship between artistic expression and social life. In doing so, we strive to follow the inspiration of the theatrical definition‚Äîto cultivate connection among artists and audiences, and to foster innovation as a creative laboratory for adaptable experimentation.\nFounded in 2018, our wide-ranging projects have brought us from major concert halls to museum galleries, the mountainous landscape of the Berkshires, the woods of Michigan, the Hudson River waterfront, and an underground karaoke bar in midtown Manhattan. Our 2024-2025 season has consisted of concerts in New York and around the country, including the season-opening performance of the Southern Exposure Series at the University of South Carolina, a residency at the University of Chicago Center for Contemporary Composition, performances Julius Eastman‚Äôs _Femenine_ with the Kyle Marshall Choreography Company at PS 21 in Chatham, NY, and performances on Bang on a Can‚Äôs _Long Play_ Festival and the Whitney Museum‚Äôs Decade Downtown celebration. Past projects include a site-responsive, outdoor music and dance performance at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts, the staged premiere of Borrowed Landscape, a radio play by German playwright duo tauchgold with music by Dai Fujikura, at the Noguchi Museum and Smithsonian Museum of Asian Art, and our inaugural BlackBox Festival, in celebration of our 5th anniversary, which featured multiple world and NYC premieres and included our debut at NYC‚Äôs historic Roulette Intermedium.\n# Dec 5\n# Scenes from the Post-Diaspora: BlackBox Ensemble performs Cheung, Mochizuki, and the US Premiere of Baldwin Giang's PIPA BOY\n# UPCOMING\n##### [Sep 9 Just Mustard ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/just-mustard)\n##### [Sep 12 Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith Present Disiniblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/rachika-nayar-and-nina-keith-present-disiniblud)\n##### [Sep 15 The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/the-grammy-museum-presents-a-new-york-evening-with-yungblud)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":null,"start_date":null,"end_date":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":null,"image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/686c3c1a66d4caabad7defc5_2.%20Still%20from%20Philadelphia.png","description":null,"event_type":null,"topics":[],"source_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/performances","detail_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/scenes-from-the-post-diaspora-blackbox-ensemble-performs-cheung-mochizuki-and-the-us-premiere-of-baldwin-giangs-pipa-boy"}}

Over the past fifteen years, she has worked relentlessly to stretch boundaries and limitations for harpists. In 2022, she made history by becoming the first Black woman to be nominated for a Grammy¬Æ Award for Best Instrumental Composition. That same year, she was also nominated for an NAACP Image Award and later, the winner of the 2024 NAACP Image Award in the category of Outstanding Jazz Album for her latest album Brand New Life. Ever-expanding as an artist, she has worked with cultural icons including Common, Lauryn Hill, John Legend, Pharoah Sanders and Christian McBride. Her original composition ‚ÄúHortense‚Äù was featured in the Netflix Concert-Documentary, Beyonc√©: Homecoming and in 2019, Brandee was selected to perform her original music as a featured performer for Quincy Jones and Steve McQueens‚Äô ‚ÄúSoundtrack of America‚Äù. Brandee is often noted for standing on the shoulders of the very women who ushered in the harp as a clear and distinct voice in jazz & popular styles -  \nparticularly Detroit natives Dorothy Ashby & Alice Coltrane. Her latest album, Brand New Life, builds on her already rich oeuvre, and cements the harp‚Äôs place in popular culture. As the title of the album suggests, Brand New Life is about forging new paths‚Äìartistic, personal, political, and spiritual. Younger's music is imbued with a sense of purpose and respect of legacy, creating a larger platform for the harp to reach newer and wider audiences than ever before. In addition to performing and recording, Brandee Younger is on the faculty at New York University, Steinhardt School and The New School College of Performing Arts.

She had emerged from the pandemic, having spent time in homebound introspection, even earning a master‚Äôs degree in Music, Science, and Technology from Stanford University.\nIn contrast, for her follow-up, the rhythmic, eclectic, contact-high of Let Me Be Water (We Make Noise, May 2025), she quite literally traveled to the ends of the world ‚Äî the Arctic Circle and Antarctica. There, she recorded the sounds of glaciers melting with hydrophones she had built at Stanford‚Äôs Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve drawn a lot of inspiration from nature,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúThis is about realizing that we are nature.‚Äù\nKiran ‚ÄúMadame‚Äù Gandhi ‚Äî who began as a percussionist for M.I.A, before exploding into a genre-defying musical artist ‚Äî has navigated many paths to get to this place of peace. A decade ago, her free-bleeding London Marathon run went viral, challenging stigmas around menstruation. Five years later, she delivered a mainstage TED Talk (‚ÄúWhy We Must Stop Dancing to the Sound of Our Own Oppression‚Äù) which elucidated her music-activism and gained millions of views online. Shortly after, the video for her song ‚ÄúWaiting For Me‚Äù won a Jury Award at SXSW 2021. In between, she toured with Daybreaker opening Oprah‚Äôs stadium tour, and her music was featured on Gutsy, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs AppleTV+ series, and Netflix‚Äôs Never Have I Ever. Recently, she received the Songwriter‚Äôs Hall of Fame Abe Olman Prize and was elected governor of her local Grammy chapter, championing unsung talent. Looking back, it‚Äôs clear Kiran has incrementally lived up to her name, which means ‚Äúray of light‚Äù in Sanskrit.\nInspiration is a living, breathing, evolving entity for this cultural force who resides between Los Angeles and London. Let Me Be Water, in kind, represents an artistic transformation for her: The album is an appreciation of the grandeur of nature, but also our collective role in this greater force. ‚ÄúIt is about flow,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt is about acceptance. It is about existing without pushback.‚Äù And that is how Let Me Be Water became the ultimate act of collaboration: Though co-produced and performed by Gandhi, it was actually composed by 40 women and gender-expansive creatives.\nIts opener, the percolating ‚ÄúLet Me Be Water,‚Äù is a deceivingly effortless track that mingles spoken-word samples and mantra-like house vocals with the aforementioned audio of melting glaciers. (Gandhi is no stranger to this aesthetic, having recorded ‚ÄúIn Purpose,‚Äù a track composed of natural sounds, for EarthPercent, a charity co-founded by Brian Eno to raise funds for environmental causes.) ‚ÄúThe song is absolutely a reference to climate, to protecting the planet,‚Äù she explains. ‚Äú‚ÄòLet me be water‚Äô ‚Äî let‚Äôs identify that we are all one with nature.‚Äù \nThe idea of unifying several musical perspectives into one album came to her after leading a pair of songwriting camps with We Make Noise, an organization and label founded by Erin Barra that‚Äôs devoted to gender equity in music. Barra invited Gandhi to mentor the teams of artists first in 2023 at The Music District in Colorado, then several months later at Arizona State University. (Alicia Key‚Äôs women-in-music organization She Is the Music as well as the nonprofit Salt Lick Incubator helped fund the effort.) Gandhi was asked to record only the winning song, she says, ‚ÄúBut after the vibe, camaraderie, and positive energy of the experience, I decided to honor the efforts of all 10 teams and make it into a 10-song album.‚Äù She tapped Colby Lapolla from the camp to co-produce the album with her and further develop the songs.\nInclusiveness drove the We Make Noise sessions: Be electric and percussive, while being uplifting and thoughtful, prioritizing lyrics with consciousness. The resulting music not only reflects these women galvanizing, but also a desire to transmit that energy to whomever is listening. For instance, the winning song, the worldly anthem ‚ÄúRise!‚Äù is a self-affirmation that doubles as a call to action. Meanwhile, the pop single ‚ÄúTake Your Time!‚Äù captures the ethos of introspection and manifestation that comes from taking those bold steps. In 2018, a USC report found that only 2% of producers are women, which means it is likely that an even smaller percentage identify as trans or gender non-conforming. This album serves as a direct response to combating this underwhelming statistic.\nTo set intentions each morning, Gandhi would lead the 40 songwriters in meditation, journaling, and gentle yoga movement. ‚ÄúIt was experimental and cool,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe looked at themes around using your purpose and passion to make a difference in the world. We looked at what it means to be aware of others, and how does that play out?‚Äù Let Me Be Water clocks in at a little over 20 minutes, the same amount of time she spends each morning meditating. ‚ÄúYou can dance, you can celebrate, you can work out, you can get your day going,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt is made with the intention of making the audience feel uplifted and empowered, and to celebrate the spirit of love.‚Äù\nA part of Let Me Be Water was inspired by Gandhi‚Äôs romantic partner, Team GB gold-medalist boxer Lesley Sackey, whom she unofficially married at Burning Man in 2023. Sackey teaches boxing to domestic violence survivors as a type of therapy and encouraged Gandhi to step into the ring for the first time, too. For three months, Gandhi trained with a team of 10 women under Sackey‚Äôs coaching, and went on to win a fight in London in 2024. The experience was so transformative that the album‚Äôs first single is the paean to the sport: ‚ÄúPisces Knockout‚Äù is an agile, auto-tuned track produced by Colby Lapolla paced to a steady flow of power-hook shots and Indian Sarangi. ‚ÄúThe song is about unmasking, about fighting the powers that keep us eating poorly and consuming harmful substances,‚Äù says Gandhi, who also became vegan and stopped drinking alcohol in recent years, ‚Äúadvertising and marketing that keep us addicted to many different things.‚Äù\nShe found boxing to be an expression of ‚Äúpersonal power and strength, stamina and commitment.‚Äù To that end, the set of photographs (shot by Lindsey Byrnes) for Let Me Be Water is inspired by the famous Life magazine photos of Muhammad Ali training underwater. She hopes the steadied liberation woven throughout Let Me Be Water will prove contagious. ‚ÄúI do feel very much like a butterfly out of the cocoon on the other side. I feel more in my power energy,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd when we show up for ourselves, it ends up being medicine for others.‚Äù\n# Mar 20\n# Madame Gandhi\n# UPCOMING\n##### [Sep 9 Just Mustard ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/just-mustard)\n##### [Sep 12 Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith Present Disiniblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/rachika-nayar-and-nina-keith-present-disiniblud)\n##### [Sep 15 The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/the-grammy-museum-presents-a-new-york-evening-with-yungblud)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":"Madame Gandhi","start_date":"2026-03-20","end_date":"2026-03-20","start_time":"19:00","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"National Sawdust, Brooklyn, NY","image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e9663cdcd7c08673a4b3788/5e96671be408a4055c6fc337_asset%200.png","description":"The hyphen-rich vocalist-percussionist-speaker-producer-activist‚Äôs vibe isn‚Äôt so much ‚Äúsinger-songwriter‚Äù as ‚Äúicon of empowerment.‚Äù Her frenetic odes to feminism, fluidity and freedom ‚Äî carried off with the assistance of an entirely female or nonbinary band ‚Äî mash together fragments of electro-pop, trap, Afrobeat and R&B, carried off with endless swagger.","event_type":"Show","topics":["Performing Arts","Music"],"source_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/performances","detail_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/madame-gandhi-3-20-26"}}

Four years ago, the artists met in Brooklyn's two-block‚Äìby‚Äìtwo-block Maria Hernandez Park after fan-girling each other‚Äôs music online. Dishing about messy post-lockdown long-distance lesbianism, heartfelt investments in Buddhist and Hindu philosophies, and a shared high-school love of the Eternal Sunshine OST, the two found their surface similarities gesturing toward a deeper shared existential worldview.

The two‚Äôs self-described ‚Äúwordless conversation,‚Äù the album orbits such themes as mortality, reinvention through destruction, and sublimating fractured histories into music‚Äîall resulting in a work that suggests sweeping transformation can come from embracing old wounds with childlike wonder.\nThe two LA-based artists meet on complementary but seemingly disparate musical grounds. On her 2022 breakout LP _Heaven Come Crashing_ , Nayar departed from her usual ambient guitar in favor of maximalist synths, sub-bass, and flickers of Amen breaks. Her distinct fusion of post-rock and electronica earned her accolades as Pitchfork's Best New Music, on several best of the year lists (The New York Times, Stereogum, Fader, GQ, Bandcamp, etc), and as the opening act on tour with M83. Keith, meanwhile, is best known for her self-trained approach to composition, as evident on her 2019 debut _MARANASATI 19111_ and its delicate medley of cello, piano, clarinet, and flute, used to explore a personal history marked by community tragedy and paranormal incidents. She expands into new territories on her forthcoming releases, like the single ‚ÄúCome Back Different‚Äù featuring Julie Byrne, by incorporating modular synths and intricate vocal arrangements with the help of various collaborators. Their combined artistic strengths exalt together on _Disiniblud_.\n\"The imagery [of the album] for me is like standing together in the abyss of our memory and reckoning with both the ineffable wonders and atrocities of our life experience,\" says Nina, \"like we‚Äôre holding and protecting each other through that process and finding a way to take both the light and dark.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about healing and moving past the darkness,‚Äù clarifies Rachika.\nNina adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taking both with you in the satchel and carrying it with you everywhere you go‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the only way you can really metabolize it.‚Äù\nThis protection Nina refers to can be as uplifting as encouraging one another to re-enliven a part of their musical repertoire‚Äîfor Rachika, it might be math-rock guitar abilities at which she shrugs that Nina insists on coaxing out of her; for Nina, it could be her vast hard drive of abandoned modular synth sketches that Rachika inspires her to put to use again (at the climax of the track \"Serpentine\" featuring Cassandra Croft, for instance). Nina describes this in metaphor like showing off an outfit she used to wear all the time three years ago that now feels outdated, but then \"the other one of us sees the jewel there and brings it out.\" Sometimes, protecting each other through the process can also be, Rachika explains, \"us both arriving at the studio in tears, holding each other for 10 minutes‚Ä¶ but instead of picking apart whatever struggles with words, we'll just start playing‚Äîand then a door opens for both of us.\"\nThough these two have such a strong intuitive connection, making music together was often unintentional. The first time Rachika visited Nina in LA before her own move, she handed Nina her suitcases and immediately sat down at Nina's new piano. Nina quickly set up microphones to record the moment of spontaneity without disturbing her, thus producing the song ‚ÄúNice rocks in my mouth‚Äù (unreleased), which they worked on for two days straight without so much as a concrete plan. \"Serpentine\" is another result of loose improvisation: Rachika absentmindedly playing guitar on Nina's bed while water dripping from Nina‚Äôs sound installation ‚ÄúPeriphone‚Äù audibly struck metallophone bars in the background. Out of a 72-minute long recording, they found a thirty second excerpt to loop behind Cassandra‚Äôs soaring soprano vocals.\nThis fluency and fluidity also intertwines with the way they'll experiment with new instruments and techniques under their mutual guidance and support. Nina refers to it as \"cosplaying as each other.\" Rachika might try her hand learning the instruments in Nina‚Äôs studio (such as piano and clarinet), while Nina will experiment with bass put through Rachika's guitar pedals and unique methods of audio time-stretching.\n\"I think we encourage each other to do things outside the ‚Äòidentity‚Äô of our solo projects, especially musical abilities from our deep pasts we've put aside for feelings around gender or shame,\" Rachika says. \"But it‚Äôs through the other‚Äôs eyes we get to bring it somewhere new.\"\nAbove all, their practice emphasizes comfort and trust before engaging in childlike play‚Äîa state of being that sheds bounded self-consciousness in favor of open imagination. Nina envisions this as she and Rachika's younger selves packing a satchel, holding hands, and daring one another to run away into a place of \"wounds and wonder,\" only to discover an unforeseeable magic in an amalgam of post-rock, glitchy indie electronica, ambient, and pop genres in this co-created realm.\n\"Blue Rags, Raging Wind,\" the most neoclassical entry on the album and rife with xylophone-esque patters, exemplifies this core of \"inner childlike joy,\" says Rachika. It was born one day out of a fun, uninhibited moment riffing out polyrhythms together on a sound installation in Nina's room. The title track \"Disiniblud\" also recalls \"going into a three-year old mind\" for the purposes of free exploration. Much of the song's mixed metallic percussion and whirring electronics came from banging on various kitchen supplies with a stick and then processing the recording into a major key anthem.\n\"I think there's something crucial about childhood and playfulness in my approach to life,‚Äù says Rachika, ‚Äúrediscovering what potential existed before the limits other people decided for you and finding out what queer things happen if you lean into those previously closed paths.\"\nRediscovering the past and excavating these \"memory networks, all of these different fears and internalized structures on how to survive in the world\" can be fruitful, says Nina, but even more than that, \"something miraculous can happen when you burn it to the ground.\" Gaining and growing often involves the process of letting go, too, as expressed in the opener \"Give-upping\" featuring Julianna Barwick. Lush with buoyant piano melodies, Barwick's fluttering vocals beckon to the listener from the other side of an \"infinite knowingness,\" says Rachika, to‚Äîas the lyrics instruct‚Äî\"Give up/ Give up/ For once if you let it.\" The song taps into a longheld Buddhist truth of clinging to past experiences as a source of one's own suffering.\nRife with almost merry-go-round samples from three different vocalists (Katie Dey, Julianna, and Willy Siegel of Ponytail), \"It's Change,\" is also a mantra of impermanence in its own right. \"There is no ground beneath us,\" insists Nina. \"You have this perfect life? It's already gone‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just dust. The structures you‚Äôve built in your life, everyone you know, will eventually pass, and that awareness allows you to see how precious it all is without clinging to this projected reality.‚Äù\nAll things go and this acknowledgement recognizes that, as Rachika describes, ‚Äúcatastrophe and freedom are twin realities bound together.‚Äù With that release and even intentional destruction, there comes a sense of peace in this larger story‚Äîa ‚Äúfairytale of two sisters ripping everything apart to find the jewel in each other.‚Äù\n**ABOUT ELORI SAXL**\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/689cd18c33017be49be57e4c_01_Elori%20Saxl%20-%20Max%20Basch.jpg)\nElori Saxl is an American experimental electronic composer.
