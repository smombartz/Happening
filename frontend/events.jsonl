Known for his use of modest, everyday materials, de Nieves explores aesthetic beauty while challenging its historical and religious underpinnings. His practice references Western religious traditions‚Äîparticularly, those of Catholicism‚Äîand ultimately reimagine places of worship as sites of transformation, despite their legacies of violence and exclusion. The exhibition presents the site-specific installation of 50 faux stained glass panels, all further inspired by the visual language of tarot.\n_How To Get To Zero_ marks the first-ever survey of work by residency alumni Tega Brain and Sam Lavigne. The exhibition presents a comprehensive look at the artists‚Äô solo and collaborative practices, which examine the present limits and future possibilities of political agency during our time of climate crisis. Over the past ten years, Brain and Lavigne have worked at the forefront of social critique and participatory art, examining subjects ranging from economic corruption to police surveillance, and from data manipulation to the commodification of everyday life. By repurposing the technologies used to perpetuate these conditions, the artists highlight the underlying conceptual and political frameworks that so often reinforce an unjust and repressive status quo.\n####  _Ra√∫l de Nieves:_ In Light of Innocence _is made possible with generous support by Bruce M. Halpryn and Chas Riebe with additional support provided by 1800 Tequila, public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, as well as the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature._\n####  _Tega Brain & Sam Lavigne: _How To Get To Zero _is made possible with support from Creative Capital. Exhibitions at Pioneer Works are supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council, and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature._\nBe the first to hear about new programs, exhibitions, and updates from Pioneer Works.\nSIGN UP\nOr consider helping us build community through the arts and sciences by [making a tax-deductible donation here](https://pioneerworks.org/support).\n**Visit** Wednesday-Sunday\n12-6 pm \n**Get Involved**[Support](https://pioneerworks.org/support)[Membership](https://pioneerworks.org/membership)[Rentals](https://pioneerworks.org/rentals)\n**About**[About Us](https://pioneerworks.org/about)[Visit](https://pioneerworks.org/visit)[Calendar](https://pioneerworks.org/calendar)[Contact Us](https://pioneerworks.org/visit)\n**Pioneer Works**\n159 Pioneer Street\nBrooklyn, NY 11231\n(718) 596-3001\n[Map](https://maps.google.com/?cid=14161060920714480924)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pioneerworks/)[](https://www.facebook.com/PioneerWorksFoundation/)[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvz10aafWdDEvO_4ehcr0jQ)[](https://twitter.com/pioneerworks_)\n¬©2025 Pioneer Works","extraction":{"title":"Opening Reception for Ra√∫l de Nieves, Tega Brain, and Sam Lavigne","start_date":"2025-09-12","end_date":"2025-09-13","start_time":"19:00","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"159 Pioneer Street, Brooklyn, NY 11231","image_url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/vgvol637/production/27c97dc5e87a50539dec381a43d6a347c96bb9d0-2000x1125.png?w=2000","description":"Join Pioneer Works in a public opening celebration of Ra√∫l de Nieves:In Light of Innocence and Tega Brain & Sam Lavigne: How To Get To Zero.","source_url":"https://pioneerworks.org/programs","detail_url":"https://pioneerworks.org/programs/fall-exhibition-opening"}}

Born and raised in Los Angeles as a first-generation Mexican-American, Yara launched her culinary journey at just 20 years old, honing her skills at esteemed establishments such as Wolfgang Puck‚Äôs Spago and Providence, a celebrated two-Michelin-starred sustainable seafood restaurant. In 2018, an invitation from David Chang to join the highly acclaimed Momofuku Ko brought her to New York City, where she would go on to join the team at Xilonen (the former sister restaurant from the Oxomoco team). At Hellbender, Yara is embarking on her first chef and owner venture, showcasing her distinctive approach to Mexican-American cuisine. Quickly established as a standout dining destination in the neighborhood, Hellbender was awarded one of  _Esquire_ ‚Äôs Best New Restaurants for 2024, and granted a two star review in  _The New York Times_. Yara's culinary journey is deeply rooted in the evolution of Mexican-American flavors, where she seamlessly blends tradition with innovation. Her efforts recently attracted attention from Star Chefs, where Yara was named one of their 2025 Rising Stars.  \n\n****[Membership](https://pioneerworks.org/membership)**** helps sustain Pioneer Works' free admission model and keep our programming affordable and accessible to everybody.

Over the years, m√∫m has collaborated with diverse artists, including Kylie Minogue and the Kronos Quartet, and has been celebrated for albums like _Yesterday Was Dramatic ‚Äì Today Is OK_ (1999) and _Smilewound_ (2013).  \n\n**About the artists**\n**m√∫m** (pronunciation: [muÀêm] - moom) is an exploratory Icelandic musical group whose music is characterized by experiments in electronic music, soft vocals, glitchy beats, innovative sampling, and eerie effects with a variety of traditional and unconventional instruments. The band was formed in 1997 by founding members Gunnar √ñrn Tynes, √ñrvar Sm√°rason, and twin sisters Gyda and Krist√≠n Anna Valtysd√≥tti. Since then, the collective has released six full-length albums, as well as a mountain of other music, singles, EP‚Äôs, collaborations, theatre, and film music. The band's lineup is in a state of constant change. So is their music.  \n\n**Mr. Silla** , aka Sigurlaug G√≠slad√≥ttir, has been a fixture in the Icelandic music and art scene for decades. A member of m√∫m since 2007, their many collaborations include a host of domestic and international acts such as Mike Lindsay (Tunng), Snorri Helgason, Mice Parade, Low Roar and Sam Potter (Late of the Pier) to name a few. Multi-instrumentalist, writer, and producer, Sigurlaug has been active since 2005, recording two solo albums (Mr. Silla, Hands On Hands) to critical acclaim, captivating audiences with their evocative stage presence and arresting vocal stylings. Make sure to be blissfully aware of the upcoming album entitled _SANDS_ , the latest collaborative project of Mr. Silla & Sam Potter, set for release next year.\n#### _Presented in collaboration with[Wordless Music](https://www.wordlessmusic.org/)._\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

As fossil fuels burn and ecosystems are destroyed, heat is driving increasingly extreme weather‚Äîturbo-charging hurricanes, floods, fires, and droughts. By 2070, one-fifth of the planet could be as scorchingly hot as the (rapidly expanding) Sahara Desert, and up to 3.5 billion people may have to move as their homes become inhospitable.\nExtreme heat is a public health threat that leads to school closures, workplace injuries, droughts, famine, mental health crises, and increased domestic violence. In the United States, heat stress is [the leading cause](https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/#&_intcmp=fxw_extreme-weather_article_main-content_article-body_2_3) of weather-related deaths‚Äîkilling more people than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined. Those among us with the fewest resources are disproportionally affected‚Äîspecifically, people of color, low-income people, children, and the elderly.\nPut simply, we now live in an entirely new climate era‚Äîone that is hotter and more unpredictable‚Äîand we are inadequately prepared for the unavoidable consequences. Heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable with proper planning, education, and action. So, how do we make our homes, neighborhoods, and cities cooler? How do we design and build for the future, with heat adaptation and risk prevention in mind? How do we care for our vulnerable populations? How do we craft policies to advance climate solutions and human well-being?\nFor a conversation grappling with how we might adapt to and live in a warming world, **Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson** will host journalist and writer**Jeff Goodell** and climate resilience expert **Jainey Bavishi** for _Science & Society: Heat Advisory_. **Brad Einstein** will offer a comedic introduction (with puppets).\nCome early and stick around to explore further into the thoughts and questions surrounding heat and health with our guest specialists who will be roving, available to engage and offer insight: renowned climate modeler and Goddard Institute of Space Studies Director **Dr. Gavin Schmidt** , historian of urban and environmental history **Dr. Kara Schlichting** , and others to be included.\nBefore and after the conversation, **DJ Mamoudou** will bring the heat to the dancefloor. On the first floor, visuals will be on view by**[OceanX](https://oceanx.org/)**, a global nonprofit working to unlock the ocean's sustainable potential‚Äîto benefit both people and the planet. On the second floor, **The Climate Story Project** ‚Äîan initiative of [The New York Climate Exchange](https://nyclimateexchange.org)‚Äîinvites you to listen to personal, pre-recorded stories about climate change and to record your own. 10-minute time slots will be available throughout the evening. In the garden, stargazing with the **Amateur Astronomers‚Äô Association** will open and conclude the night, weather-permitting. All evening, **[For All Things Good](https://www.forallthingsgoodbk.com/) **will be serving up fresh Mexican food.\nOur signature series [_Science & Society_](https://pioneerworks.org/series/science-and-society) grapples with our relationships with nature and each other. Each leads us deep into humanity‚Äôs timely and intersectional challenges, from biodiversity to plastics, public knowledge, the high seas, farming, climate, and love.\n**About the Speakers**\n**Jainey Bavishi** is a nationally recognized expert in climate resilience. She most recently served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Deputy Administrator of NOAA.

He conquered Detroit's early techno scene as The Wizard in the 1980s, as part of the collective Underground Resistance. Afterwards, in the 2000s, he became inspired by space and science fiction, and started merging his interests with other art forms. He decided to create a new soundtrack for Fritz Lang's _Metropolis_ , which brought him to many other cine-mix performances and movie soundtracks. As a fine artist, Mills has shown numerous performances and exhibitions in galleries and museums such as the CCCB of Barcelona; the Southbanke Center and the Barbican in London; the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise and Pompidou Center in Paris; and the Art Fair Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n**Jean Philippe Dary** is a keyboard player, singer, producer, arranger, and songwriter. Born in France with Guyanese roots, he‚Äôs worked with African singers like Papa Wemba, Tourƒó Kunda, Omar Pene, and Alpha Blondy. He also worked on other projects and musical styles such as jazz (Paco Sery, Greg Osby, Brice Wassy, Hopen Collective, Pino Daniele), reggae (Sly And Robbie), pop and electronic music (Phoenix, Troublemakers). During these last 20 years, he has spent most of his time working with friend Tony Allen. They have recorded eight albums with artists like Jeff Mills, Damon Albarn, TY and Ernest Ranglin. He is the third member of Tomorrow Comes the Harvest.\n**Prabhu Edouard** is an Indo-French percussionist and composer. Regarded as one of the most versatile tabla players of his generation, Edouard is a worthy disciple of renowned tabla maestro Pandit Shankar Ghosh. His album _K√îLAM_ highlights his compositionally innovative and contemporary vision of Indian music. Not only a sought after performer, Edouard is also an experienced pedagogue sharing his talents during various percussion masterclasses and international music seminars.\n**Tomorrow Comes The Harvest** is the cumulative effort of talented musicians and their shared visions of what makes the art form of music so special. The concept was initiated and brought to life by the late Afrobeats creator and Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and Detroit techno pioneer Jeff Mills. Each artist belongs to a long tradition of using music to reach higher levels of consciousness. Joined by veteran keyboardist Jean-Phi Dary, the trio toured internationally until the untimely passing of Tony Allen in 2020. By then, however, the foundation of the project had been firmly established and was ready to evolve. Mills has reconfigured the concept once more as a trio, inviting tabla virtuoso Prabhu Edouard to join the ensemble.\nTomorrow Comes The Harvest is about exploring the unknown‚Äîtranscending boundaries through the intersection of sound and rhythm, guided by an array of improvisational movements.\n####  _This program takes place within artist Ra√∫l de Nieves‚Äôs site-specific installation,_ In Light of Innocence _.

At National Sawdust, supporting emerging artists is our core mission, nurturing a wide array of voices who are collectively reshaping the landscape of new music for this new century. The work we champion and help support speaks to the National Sawdust DNA: empowering high-level artistry, regardless of genre, by multicultural artists who tell their stories through their music.‚Äù\n‚Äì Paola Prestini, Composer, Co-Founder and Artistic Director\n[VIEW ALL UPCOMING](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/performances-prev)\n# EVENT\n# PHOTO GALLERY\n[VIEW MORE](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/ideas-archive)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7e19d93f3fb8e9a9122e4_13_NS_Chloe%20Flower%20_%20Krug%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7e179f7d0d576cce65d32_12_NS_Avon2%20\\(1\\)%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7e15fb42fd533f5f393b0_11_NS_Avon1%20\\(1\\)%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7e1297abecc835f88c54d_10_NationalSawdustJune7th2022126%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7e11f6302b9e86161f68a_09_IMG_2800%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7e0e7f01eb93d1330d490_08_euphoria%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7df4bfda79ed08a28da8d_07_EPICURIAN-NIGHTS-20181105-5472-1030x687.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7df16d9a6cb7b2fcbd982_06_DgUJ4vAU8AIpzcS.jpg-large%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7decf7374df45ec485f49_05_Billboard%202%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7de6cb42fd50b1af3660b_04_Billboard%201%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7de3e0374f0f598bfebf8_03_Arc_teryx%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7de047abeccd45788a649_02_Adidas%20copy.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e7ddee145d7332714db7a0_01_38465797791_a1bb952254_h.jpg)](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events)\n# DOWNLOADS\n##### Projection Mapping Info\n##### [DOWNLOAD](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e8624318b94848b7b0acd6_4.NS%20Tech%20Projection%20Info%20Deck.pdf)\n##### Floor Plan\n##### [DOWNLOAD](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e8620e273b5c69bd739fdf_3.NS%20Floor%20Plan%20Main%20Hall.png)\n##### Tech Specs & Meyer Sound System Profile\n##### [DOWNLOAD](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/62e861dfb58df9053d904be4_2.NS%20Tech%20Specs%20-%20%20private%20events.pdf)\n##### Special Events Deck\n##### [DOWNLOAD](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ea4ada849d1a708b00fb8b1/6838787975e266e54d649086_NS%20Events%20Deck.pdf)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":null,"start_date":null,"end_date":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":null,"image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e9663cdcd7c08673a4b3788/5e96671be408a4055c6fc337_asset%200.png","description":null,"source_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/performances","detail_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/special-events"}}

Please email****guestservices@grammymuseum.org****.**\n**ABOUT YUNGBLUD**\nYungblud AKA Dominic Harrison is the 27-year-old from Doncaster who has achieved two UK number-one albums, generated six billion Spotify streams globally, and broken into the Billboard Top 100 with his last two albums.\nIn 2024, Yungblud debuted his own festival, Bludfest, at The National Bowl in Milton Keynes, where he presented a curated lineup of artists, headlining the bill himself. That same year, he released You Need to Exist: A Book to Love and Destroy on Penguin Publishing, which became an instant No.1 Sunday Times Bestseller.\nThis summer, Yungblud will release his fourth studio album, _IDOLS_.\nOn **_IDOLS,_ Yungblud **explores the theme of hero-worship; how we look to others for validation, often putting others‚Äô lives on a pedestal at the expense of the richness of our own experiences. **Yungblud** says, ‚Äú _We turn to others for an identity before turning to ourselves. Self-belief, self-reclamation, self-evolution and change. As we grow up, we lose our belief in magic and mystery. We begin to rationalize everything; our cage walls build up._ ‚Äù He added, ‚Äú _We compare ourselves to 15 different people before we‚Äôve even had our breakfast_ ‚Äù.**‚Äç**\n‚Äç**  \nABOUT _YUNGBLUD. ARE YOU READY, BOY?_**\nThe feature-length documentary, directed by three-time**Grammy Award-nominated** ,**Emmy¬Æ** and **BAFTA-** winning filmmaker**Paul Dugdale** (_Adele: One Night Only_ , _Elton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium_ , _The Prodigy 'Worlds on Fire‚Äô_ , _Glastonbury Festival: Live at Worthy Farm_) was shot at the legendary **Hansa Studios Building** in **Berlin** , the birthplace of **David Bowie** ‚Äôs **_Heroes,_** **U2‚Äôs _Achtung Baby!_** and countless other iconic albums.\nA personal journey of change, confidence and rock-and-roll chaos, set against a city that has always celebrated counterculture and creativity, **_YUNGBLUD. ARE YOU READY, BOY?_** is a revealing and uncompromising documentary about a generational artist finding his own voice.\nPresented in B&W and colour, including stunning sequences shot in 16mm, the two-hour-long documentary shows **Yungblud** at a pivotal moment in his career. The film follows the artist as he relocates to the historic Berlin studio with his band to record live performances of tracks from his brand-new album, **_Idols_** , for the very first time. His most personal record to date, **_Idols_** was released in June 2025 to critical acclaim, becoming **Yungblud‚Äôs** third consecutive no. 1 album in the UK. With cameras rolling throughout the entire process and no live audience present, the project removes any artifice, presenting a truthful and unapologetic behind-the-scenes look at the creative process and the performances in its purest form, highlighting the intimate relationships and dynamic between Dom, the band and the music.\n# Sep 15\n# The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud\n# UPCOMING\n##### [Sep 9 Just Mustard ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/just-mustard)\n##### [Sep 12 Rachika Nayar and Nina Keith Present Disiniblud ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/rachika-nayar-and-nina-keith-present-disiniblud)\n##### [Sep 16 Devendra Banhart (Solo) with support from Kath Bloom ](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/devendra-banhart-solo-with-support-from-kath-bloom-9-16)\n[**  \n  \nREVIEW OUR IN-VENUE COVID PROTOCOLS**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/health-safety-protocols)\n[**National Sawdust DEI/Anti-Racism Commitment  \n  \n‚Äç**](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/DEI-statement)[**National Sawdust Code of Ethics**](https://nationalsawdust.org/code-of-ethics)\nContact\n(646) - 779 - 8455  \n80 North 6th St  \nBrooklyn, NY 11249  \n  \ninfo@nationalsawdust.org\nFOLLOW US\n[](https://www.facebook.com/NationalSawdust/)[](https://www.instagram.com/nationalsawdust/)[](https://twitter.com/nationalsawdust)[](https://vimeo.com/nationalsawdust/)\n[](https://www.nationalsawdust.org/bloomberg-connects)\n_  \n  \n‚Äç_  \n\nCopyright 2022","extraction":{"title":"The GRAMMY Museum presents A New York Evening With Yungblud","start_date":"2025-09-15","end_date":"2025-09-15","start_time":"19:30","end_time":null,"timezone":null,"location_address":"80 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249","image_url":"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e9663cdcd7c08673a4b3788/5e96671be408a4055c6fc337_asset%200.png","description":"Yungblud to perform at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, NY for a special live performance.","source_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/performances","detail_url":"https://www.nationalsawdust.org/event/the-grammy-museum-presents-a-new-york-evening-with-yungblud"}}
